I scorn you, scurvy companion. What, you poor, base, rascally, cheating, lack-linen mate! Away, you moldy rogue, away!   Thou mewling toad-spotted miscreant!   [Thou art] a most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise breaker, the owner of no one good quality.   Thou puking rump-fed ratsbane!   Thou jarring beef-witted flap-dragon!   Methink'st thou art a general offence and every man should beat thee.
